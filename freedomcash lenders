Another troubling reality is that payday loans often last well beyond the next payday—wreaking havoc on borrowers’ already fragile budgets. When fees are included, a typical payday loan payment takes one-third of a borrower’s next paycheck, an amount that most consumers who turn to payday lenders cannot afford. Faced with that unmanageable payment, borrowers instead pay an additional interest-only fee of about $55 to roll over the loan, staving off payment of the full amount until the next payday, and the next, and the next—all the while incurring additional fees. Today, the average payday loan borrower is in debt for nearly six months a year and pays an average of $520 in fees for $375 in credit.
