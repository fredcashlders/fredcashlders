Overall, payday lenders in Colorado are serving about the same number of borrowers under the reform legislation but with better outcomes, including more affordable repayments, fewer defaults, and more reasonable loan durations.

Colorado should be a national model for federal regulators working on payday loan reforms. Borrowers will also be well-served if regulators design rules in a way that attracts more traditional lenders—banks and credit unions—to enter this market with lower-cost alternatives. Many people mistakenly assume that borrowers go to payday lenders because they are “unbanked,” meaning they’re outside the traditional banking system either by choice or by necessity. However, two of the key requirements for obtaining a payday loan are proof of income and a checking account. Thus, these customers, by definition, have to be “banked.”
