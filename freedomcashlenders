freedomcashlenders12 million Americans take out payday loans. Interest rates are very high, with APRs averaging 390 percent. By the time the loan is repaid, the fees involved typically have far exceeded the original loan amount. Fees paid on these loans total about $7 billion a year, burdening borrowers—many living paycheck-to-paycheck—who cannot afford such financial strain.

Stronger safeguards are coming. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is working on new regulatory standards. The prospect of tougher rules worries the payday lenders, who contend they will destroy their industry and leave borrowers without options. For the freedomcashlenders, the challenge is to strike a balance—make payday loans less burdensome for borrowers without cutting off access to small-dollar consumer credit.
